<statement>

Given a system of measurement, every segment can be assigned a unique positive number called it's length. Given <m>\overline{PQ}</m>, it's length will be denoted by <m>PQ</m>. Conversely, given a point <m>P</m> on a line <m>l</m>, for every positive number <m>x</m> there are two unique points <m>Q</m> and <m>R</m> on line <m>l</m> such that <m>Q</m>-<m>P</m>-<m>R</m> and <m>QP = PR=x</m>.
