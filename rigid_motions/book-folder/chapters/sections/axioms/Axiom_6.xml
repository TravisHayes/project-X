<statement>

<ol>

<li> Every plane contains at least three distinct non-collinear points.</li>
<li> Every line lies in at least one plane.</li>
<li> Given three distinct non-collinear points, there is exactly one plane containing those three points.</li>
<li> If two distinct points lie in a plane, then the line through those two points lies entirely in that plane.</li>
