<statement>
Every angle can be assigned a unique positive number less than 180 called it's Degree Measure. Conversely, given distinct points <m>P</m> and <m>Q</m> on line <m>l</m> and a positive number <m>x</m> less than 180, on each side of <m>l</m> there is a point <m>R</m> such that <m>\angle{QPR}</m> has measure <m>x</m>. Furthermore, <m>\overrightarrow{PR}</m> is the unique ray with this property.
